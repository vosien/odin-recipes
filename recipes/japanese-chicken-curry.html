        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            Japanese curry is a thick curry with a stew-like consistency and commonly includes protein, sweet onions, carrots, and potatoes. The sauce is thickened
            by a roux (a mixture of fat and flour and an addition of curry spices).
        </p>
        <p>
            You can find many variations of Japanese curries, ranging from regions to households, but the most basic one uses chicken, which is the recipe I&rsquo;m
            sharing here.
        </p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1&frac12; lb boneless, skinless chicken thigh</li>
            <li>2 onions</li>
            <li>2 carrots</li>
            <li>3 Yukon gold potatoes</li>
            <li>1 tsp ginger <i>(grated)</i></li>
            <li>2 cloves garlic</li>
            <li>&frac12; apple</li>
            <li>black pepper</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>For the Curry</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1&frac12; tbsp neutral oil</li>
            <li>4 cups chicken stock</li>
            <li>1 tbsp honey</li>
            <li>1 tbsp soy sauce</li>
            <li>1 tbsp ketchup</li>
            <li>1 package Japanese curry roux</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>For Serving</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>8 cups cooked jasmine rice</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Heat the neutral oil in a large pot over medium heat. Add the onions and saute for 10 minutes, stirring occasionally, until they become translucent
                and tender. Avoid frequent stirring to caramelize.
            </li>
            <li>Add the minced garlic and grated ginger. Stir well to combine and release their aroma.</li>
            <li>
                Add the chicken and cook, stirring frequently, until the pieces are no longer raw on the outside. If the onions begin to brown too much, lower the heat
                to medium-low.
            </li>
            <li>
                Pour in the chicken stock before stirring in the grated apple, honey, soy sauce, and ketchup until well incorporated. Add the carrots and potatoes.
                <i>The broth should just barely cover the ingredients&mdash;additional liquid will be released from the vegetables and meat as they cook.</i>
            </li>
            <li>
                Cover and simmer on medium-low heat for 15 minutes, stirring occasionally. <i>If the ingredients are fully submerged, simmer uncovered instead to allow
                reduction.</i> Once the mixture comes to a boil, skim off any scum from the surface using a fine-mesh strainer. Continue cooking, covered, until a skewer
                or knife easily pierces the carrots and potatoes.
            </li>
            <li>
                Turn off the heat. Add 1 cube of curry roux to a ladle filled with the broth. Stir with a spoon or chopsticks until dissolved, then mix it into the pot.
                Repeat with the reamin roux until fully incorporated.
            </li>
            <li>
                Simmer uncovered over medium-low heat for 5-10 minutes, stirring frequently, until the curry thickens. <i>If it becomes too thick, adjust the consistency
                with a spash of water.</i> Sitr well to ensure nothing sticks to the bottom of the pot. Serve immediately over white rice.
